# chark1es's modpack

## Important Information:

-   Please read through the entire modpack info to get the most up-to-date information. If there are any breaking changes when updating the modpack, then it will be posted here.

## Modpack Details:

This modpack is mainly a quality of life modpack. I looked through a lot of mods and tried to choose stable and reliable mods to ensure everyone doesn't have any issues.

## New Keybind(s):

This modpack has mods that these keybinds:

`e` - Push players around
`f` - Toggle flashlight if the flashlight is in your inventory
`r` - Hold to talk when a walkie talkie is in your inventory
`3` - Middle finger emote
`4` - Clap emote
`5` - Shy emote
`6` - The Griddy

For the terminal:
`right-arrow` & `left arrow` - Switch between players when viewing the monitor in the terminal

## New Command(s):

In chat:

`/restart` - Prompts you to confirm or deny. If you confirm, it will perform a quick restart and you will lose everything within the ship. Only the **host** can initiate this command.

## Menu Modification(s):

## Gameplay Modification(s)s:

-   A new HUD is replaced. This is client side and you may disable the HUD if you do not like it.

-   You are now able to look more downwards

-   More suit colors have been added and are automatically on the rack.

-   Nametags are reworked and now display a volume icon above the player when they are talking.

-   When `right-clicking` to scan in the ship, a more accurate total will be displayed (it will only calculate items in the ship and not in your hand, you must either drop the item or store the item in the cabinet).

-   When `right-clicking` to scan in the ship, the clock will also be displayed.

-   At the company, there will now be a sign that shows the total price of the items on the counter

-   At the end of every day, the death messages shows how the player died

-   In the main menu, you will be able to change the keybinds. I also added it to where you can use keybinds on your mouse as well.

-   I added the `Skibidi` music for funsies
-   There is a mirror that you can purchase. It has no other function then to show the reflection of yourself.

## Multiplayer Modification(s):

-   When hosting a game, you have the option to choose up to 20 (or 40) players. However, the recommended limit is 8 players.

-   When the game has started, if another player wants to join the game, you must complete your run (aka end the day) and then invite the player. You won't be able to invite the player when the ship has landed on a moon or at the company.

-   There's a compatability checker installed to make sure everyone has the same mod version.

-   I added a mod that skips you to the online menu screen when the game boots.
